1.0 indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units

1.1 activity [chr]: derived from activity code (1-6)
    1 WALKING
    2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    4 SITTING
    5 STANDING
    6 LAYING

1.2 subject [int]: volunteer subject identifier (1-30)

1.3 variable [Factor]: feature measuring mean or standard deviation from "features.txt"

1.4 average [num]: average value of variable, in same units as the feature, either acceleration (g = m/s^2) or velocity (radians/second)

2.0 other relevant information

2.1 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set and appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
2.1.1 read data
2.1.2 rename variables
2.1.3 merge data (rbind)
2.1.3 merge data (cbind)

2.2 Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
2.2.1 select variables with 'mean(' or 'std(' in name using regex functions

2.3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
2.3.1 add column for activity (from 'activity_labels.txt')

2.4 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
2.4.1 melt variable and value by activity and subject
2.4.2 group_by (activity, subject and variable) and summarize (mean of value)

2.5 Save results in TXT file
